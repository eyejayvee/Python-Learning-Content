# Welcome to Python for Data Engineering & Analytics

The material covered in this course is not intended to teach you Python. For this we recommend that you consider the following resources:

## Introduction to Python

1. [Datacamp - Python Fundamentals](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/python-fundamentals) - _fee_
2. [W3Schools - Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) - free
3. [Udemy - 100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) - fee

Course material will however provide an overview of some of the common Python libraries used for data analysis including:

## Course Topics

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Plotly
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib

To name a few. Will be using Jupyter as the user environment in which code is written and run. Finally, we will briefly take a look at a web scraping example that also does provides and example of sentiment analysis.

Should you choose to persue data engineering/wrangling and analysis further, there is an excellent book written by _Wes McKinney_ - **Python for Data Analysis**, which can be [read online](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) or by [purchasing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Data-Analysis-3e-Wrangling/dp/109810403X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) a copy of the book/ebook, and supporting the author.
