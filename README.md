# Welcome to Python for Data Analytics

The material covered in this course is not intended to teach you Python. For this we recommend that you consider the following resources:

## Introduction to Python

1. [Datacamp - Python Fundamentals](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/python-fundamentals) - _fee_
2. [W3Schools - Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) - free
3. [Udemy - 100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) - fee

Course material will, however provide an overview of some of the common Python libraries used for data analysis, including:

## Course Topics

1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
4. [Plotly](https://plotly.com)
5. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

...to name a few. Datacamp has a great cheatsheet that provides a quick reference to these libraries, which can be found [here](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1694526244/Marketing/Blog/Python_Basics_Cheat_Sheet-updated.pdf).

We will be using Jupyter as the user environment in which code is written and run. Finally, we will briefly look at a web scraping example that also provides an example of sentiment analysis.

Should you choose to pursue data engineering/wrangling and analysis further, there is an excellent book written by _Wes McKinney_ - **Python for Data Analysis**, which can be [read online](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) or by [purchasing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Data-Analysis-3e-Wrangling/dp/109810403X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) a copy of the book/ebook, and supporting the author.
